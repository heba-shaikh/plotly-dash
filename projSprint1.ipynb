    "This data provides insight into different Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Hospitals and includes their hospital name, address, city, state, ZIP code, county name, phone number, condition, as well as data analyzing the timeliness and effectiveness of each hospital, measured by different aspects such as wait times and service provided. Therefore, I selected this data because I find it to be relevant to my term project, although it might not allow me to fulfill my initial vision to its fullest extent, I can still create an analysis on which hospitals would be optimal for different patients depending on their scores and convenience in location."

    "There were originally 1651 observations in this dataset. However, the score column, which is the most important column in this case, had 1277 rows as \"Not Available\", which I found to be equivalent to n/a. So, I converted these to n/a and dropped these rows. This made me end up with 374 total observations. There are 9 unique Measure Names, 4 unique conditions, and 117 county names. Other than the n/a's in the score column, there was no missing data. The main continuous variable is \"score\" and it can be seen from the above cell that the standard deviation is ~118 and that there are definitely outliers on the upper end of the distribution.I am deciding to keep these outliers because they show the stark difference in hospital scores on the higher end. If they were outliers on the lower end, I would have removed them because they wouldn't be helpful for my purposes of choosing high scoring hospitals nearby."
